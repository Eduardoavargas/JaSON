NEXT:
- Response formatting
- remove onHeadersChange from RequestFields
- move images out of src? but they're imported?

TODO
- Make history work
- Restrict size of response shown
- Show time in ms next to status code
- Tooltip on request body when not editable to explain why
- Update NOTICE
- Update screenshots
- Update Chrome Web Store description - specifically mention cookies
- Update readme.md

BUGS:
- Switch to "Response" tab automatically on submit
- Clear response fields on "Reset fields" button click

IDEAS:
- star a history item
- delete all except starred history items
- save history to dropbox or export somehow?
- share a history request with someone (export and email, click to send?)
- group history by domain to make searching easier
- filter history by domain, content type, request method, response status etc...

NOTES:
- in responsive mode set dimensions to 1423x889 to get 1280x800 screenshots
