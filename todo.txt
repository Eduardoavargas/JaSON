TODO:
- Update NOTICE
- Update screenshots
- Update Chrome Web Store description - specifically mention cookies
- Update readme.md
- Replace versions throughout with version from package.json
- Convert to Typescript

Ideas:
- star a history item
- delete all except starred history items
- save history to dropbox or export somehow?
- share a history request with someone (export and email, click to send?)
- group history by domain to make searching easier
- filter history by domain, content type, request method, response status etc...

Chrome screenshots:
- in responsive mode set dimensions to 1423x889 to get 1280x800 screenshots
