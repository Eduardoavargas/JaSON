Feature requests:
- star a history item
- delete all except starred history items
- save history to dropbox or export somehow?

Random ideas:
- share a history request with someone (export and email, click to send?)
- group history by domain to make searching easier
- filter history by domain, content type, request method, response status etc...

TODO:
- add all third party libraries to NOTICE
- add angular-highlightjs for syntax highlighting
